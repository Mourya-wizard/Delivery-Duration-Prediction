# Delivery Duration Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a delivery duration prediction model that uses machine learning techniques to estimate the time it takes for a delivery to reach its destination. Predicting delivery durations accurately can help businesses optimize their logistics, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed decisions regarding delivery routes and scheduling.

## Getting Started

To get started with the delivery duration prediction model, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delivery-duration-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd delivery-duration-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can use the delivery duration prediction model as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your delivery data in the format expected by the model. Ensure that you have features such as pickup location, delivery location, time of day, and any other relevant information.

2. **Load the Model**: Load the trained model using the provided script or import it into your own Python code.

3. **Predict Delivery Duration**: Use the loaded model to predict delivery durations for new deliveries. You can provide the necessary input features to the model, and it will return the estimated delivery duration.

4. **Visualization (Optional)**: You can also create visualizations or reports to analyze the model's predictions and performance.

## Data

The quality of predictions depends on the quality and relevance of the data used for training. Ensure that your dataset includes the following information:

- Pickup location (latitude and longitude)
- Delivery location (latitude and longitude)
- Time of pickup
- Time of delivery
- Other relevant features (e.g., weather conditions, traffic data, holiday information)

## Training the Model

If you want to train your own delivery duration prediction model, you can use the provided training script. Follow these steps:

1. Prepare a labeled dataset with delivery duration as the target variable.

2. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data_path /path/to/dataset.csv --model_output /path/to/save/model
   ```

3. The trained model will be saved in the specified directory.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, you can use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The evaluation script is provided for your convenience.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --data_path /path/to/test/dataset.csv
```

## Deployment

When deploying the delivery duration prediction model in a production environment, consider using web frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to create a RESTful API for making predictions. Ensure that the model is retrained periodically to maintain its accuracy.
